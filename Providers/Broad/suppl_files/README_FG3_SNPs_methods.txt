SNPs were detected against the FG3 version of the Gibberella zeae assembly of
strain PH-1 (AACM02000000), with sequencing reads from strain GZ3639. Reads
were aligned to the FG3 assembly using Blat, and reads that did not have a
unique placement in the assembly or had >20% gaps in the alignment were
rejected. The Neighborhood Quality Standard (NQS) algorithm was used to
identify high confidence polymorphic sites. SNPs were identified as
single-base sequence variants that had a minimum PHRED base quality of 25 at
the position of mismatch, a neighborhood base quality of 20, and no mismatches
within 5 bp. In total, 10,308 SNPs were identified between PH-1 and GZ3639 reads.
